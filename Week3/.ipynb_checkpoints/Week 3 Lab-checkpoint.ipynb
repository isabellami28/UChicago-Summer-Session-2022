    "c) Notice that since the Country variable is a categoirical variable, we need to use some kind of numeric indicator to replace the string values in that column. We use dummy variables. A dummy variable is a binary variable that indicates whether a separate categorical variable takes on a specific value. For example, we will add 9 columns  to the data set and name column by the syntax 'Country_[country name]'. Each column will only take on the values 0 or 1; 0 represents that the observation on that row does not belong to the country and 1 represents that the observation on that row belongs to the country. For example, the rows where the Country value is USA' will have the Country_USA column being 1, and the Country_Denmark, Country_France, and so on columns being 0. <br><br>\n",
